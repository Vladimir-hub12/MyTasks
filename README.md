# TaskManager
## This console application allows you to plan tasks and sort them by importance.
## Whether it’s an important business meeting, a reminder to pick up clothes from the dry cleaner, or a birthday party, with this application you won’t forget anything.

  Adding a task is easy – simply type "Add task" and then enter the new task.
  To view the list of created tasks, type "List".
  To remove a task, type Remove task", press Enter, then enter the number of the task you want to delete and press Enter again.
  To exit the application, type "Exit" and press Enter.


   This application is part of my course **Programming in Java for Beginners**.\
   Any feedback or suggestions for improvement are welcome.

   For now, I am still working on the application; it will be up and running soon, I hope.
